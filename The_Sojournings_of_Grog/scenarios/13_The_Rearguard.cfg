#textdomain wesnoth-The_Sojournings_of_Grog

#
# MAP
#
# large, quasi-circular, grassy valley in the middle of the mountains
# (slightly elongated to the SW and NE).
# because its high in the hills though there was no snow in the last scenarios(early spring)
# there are still patches of snow here and there.
# mountains surround the valley (normal and inaccessable).
# the pass comes in from the west (mountains on both sides), runs halfway
# along the top of the map, across the valley and into the NE.
# Saurian castles are at both ends of the valley (SW and NE) and the path runs between them.
# (though considerably closer to the NE one)
# You start the scenario at the start of the path in the NW (no castle means you cant recruit).
# Saurian one starts in the NE
# Saurian 2 in the SW
# The saurians are this way round so that the fight happens as close to the west as possible.
#
# STRATEGY
#
# You win either reaching the end of the pass(if you didn attack the saurians)
# or by killing the saurians if you did.
# There is no bonus for killing the saurians except the free experience.
# The saurians are programmed so that fight in a strip across the valley.
# (This requires a lot of AI programming)
# They will attack you but not often.
# As soon as you kill one of them they will gang up on you.
# The scenario is balenced so it is easier to not kill the saurians but you lose the experience.
#
# BONUSES
#
# None. This is meant to be a "breather" between B1/2 and B4.
#
# VARIABLES
#
# killed_saurians = have you killed the saurians.
#
# TODO
#
# PARTIALLY DONE in the start event have the saurians talk and then have Grog and everyone else move in using the {MOVE_HERO_IN} macro from B6.
# Add cairns (?) (in 1.9) to 18,16 and 26,11 (?)
